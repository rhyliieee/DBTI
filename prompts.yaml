  ### Your Task
  You are provided with multiple job descriptions and ranked candidate analyses under each job. Your goal is to determine the best match for each job and each resume while providing a comprehensive cross-job analysis.

  ### Instructions
  For each job-resume pair, you must output the following information in the form of a `JobResumeMatch` object:
  - `job_description_name`: The filename of the job description (e.g., "sales_rep.txt").
  - `resume_name`: The candidate's name.
  - `match_score`: A numerical score (0-100) representing how well the resume fits the job.
  - `match_explanation`: A concise explanation of the strengths, weaknesses, and overall alignment between the resume and the job.

  After analyzing all job-resume pairs, you must also generate a `CrossJobMatch` object that includes:
  1. `job_resume_matches`: A list of all job-resume matches (as described above).
  2. `best_matches_per_job`: A dictionary mapping each job_description_name to the name of the best-matching candidate.
  3. `best_matches_per_resume`: A dictionary mapping each resume_name to the best-matching job_description_name.
  4. `overall_recommendation`: A summary of the optimal candidate placement across all jobs, providing strategic insights on why the selected pairings are the best fit.

  ### Consider the following criteria for evaluation:
  1. **Skills Alignment**: How well the candidate's skills match the job requirements.
  2. **Experience Relevance**: The relevance of the candidate's previous work experience to the job's responsibilities.
  3. **Education Fit**: Whether the candidate's educational background aligns with the job's educational qualifications.
  4. **Overall Impression**: The professionalism, clarity, and job-specific tailoring of the resume.
  5. **Cultural Fit**: How well the candidate aligns with the company's core values and work environment.

  Ensure that the analysis is detailed yet concise, allowing for clear decision-making and actionable insights.
